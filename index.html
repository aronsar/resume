<p><em>Software Engineer for <a href="https://ziteo.com/">Ziteo
Medical</a></em></p>
<p><em>Improved Imager Performance:</em> Collaboratively worked with the
gamma imaging team to transform their data processing for handling up to
500 GB datasets. Addressed core issue where the original code not only
loaded the entire dataset into memory but also created multiple
intermediate copies, increasing memory usage to 5-10 times the original
size. Resolved this by modifying the algorithm to work on smaller data
chunks, introducing a class for efficient data loading and saving by
chunks, and setting up a preprocessing pipeline to speed up the stable
parts of the processing pipeline, thereby significantly improving
processing speed and reducing memory usage.</p>
<p><em>Ultrasound App:</em> Developed, integrated, and maintained a C++
application to interface with a third-party ultrasound device, employing
its COM-based architecture. Created a wrapper class to manage
device-system interactions for real-time ultrasound image processing.
Also implemented a mock version of the wrapper class, enabling a
Linux-based simulation mode that enhanced cross-platform testing and
development.</p>
<p><em>Clinical GUI:</em> Refactored the clinical GUI, transitioning
from a thin-layer structure to a more distributed ownership model,
aligning parent-child relationships of GUI objects with their graphical
hierarchy. Implemented a global singleton to manage long-range
connections between GUI elements using Python dictionaries and
descriptive keys, improving GUI functionality and adaptability.</p>

<dd>
<p><em>Software Engineer for <a href="https://www.noahmed.com/">Noah
Medical</a></em></p>
<p>Led the development and maintenance of the Python repository for a
haptic-feedback controlled surgical robot, writing applications and
utilities now used by several other teams, such as RTI DDS packet
handling, a unified test and simulation framework for the robot
instrument kinematics, a Qt-based GUI for controlling the robot and
visualizing its data, and a fluidics control application.</p>
<p><em>Instrument Characterization:</em> Built a Python application that
merged robotic command data with real-time electromagnetic sensor
measurements (and later OptiTrack Motion Capture measurements) to
characterize instrument error. Included the implementation of forward
kinematics using matrix libraries numpy and scipy.</p>
<p><em>Engineering UI:</em> Developed the Engineering UI, an Qt-based
GUI for controlling the system, handling and displaying logs, and
visualizing system status. Showed a real time visualization of the
articulated instrument, using the same backend as the Instrument
Characterization.</p>
<p><em>Fluidics App:</em> Developed, maintained, and extended an
application to control the fluidics system. Began as a Python app
talking to an arduino to control the valves themselves, and later turned
into a C++ subsystem controlling the devices through etherCAT.</p>

<dt>2019 - 2021</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Masters student researching game AI</em> (Advisor: Joshua
McCoy)</p>
<p>Led the creation of the <a
href="https://github.com/aronsar/hoad">Hanabi Open Agent Dataset
(HOAD)</a>, coordinating a team of six undergraduates in porting 15
diverse Hanabi playing agents into a unified platform. Developed and
tested a training pipeline for neural network imitators of each HOAD
agent, conducting evaluations against meta-learned agents, naive MLP
agents, and other HOAD agents. Helped implement Model Agnostic
Meta-Learning (Finn 2017) in TensorFlow 2.0, specifically for
meta-learning agent imitations in HOAD. Demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments that meta-learned agents using MAML will
outperform both randomly selected partners, and a naive form of ad-hoc
learning, and used results to propose a solution to DeepMind’s Hanabi
Ad-Hoc Challenge.</p>

<dd>
<p><em>Masters student researching video annotation</em> (Advisor: Zhou
You)</p>
<p>Analyzed failure modes of Cross-Task (Zhukov 2019), a weakly
supervised video annotation model for YouTube instructional videos, to
identify the main error sources. Developed a regex parser for wikiHow,
creating a dataset of instructional guides aimed at refining
Cross-Task’s approach to temporal action labeling.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2017 - 2018</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Undergraduate researching image segmentation</em> (Advisor:
Yong-Jae Lee)</p>
<p>Integrated the data augmentation algorithm Hide and Seek with DCSP
image segmentation (Chaudhry 2017) to achieve an mIoU performance boost
of 0.6% on ImageNet, and further developed an improvement for Hide and
Seek by replacing the randomly sized patches with object size-based
patches (determined using a saliency map of the object). This refinement
further improved the model’s performance by 0.25%, as verified through a
hyperparameter study using 32 GPUs on 8 Azure VMs.</p>
